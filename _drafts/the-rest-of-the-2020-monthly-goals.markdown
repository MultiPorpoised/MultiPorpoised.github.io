TODO: date, finish, proofread, TODOs, links/backlinks, publish

I stopped posting these in 2020 because writing them up felt too cumbersome.
I still did wrote up personal bullet-style goals and retrospectives, each month,
but I didn't bother polishing them into prose for this blog.
I'd prefer not to just leave this hanging, so I'm going to do a rapid-fire
overview of what my goals were for each month, how it went, and the key
takeaways. This isn't intended to be as polished or complete as the previous
entries, and won't provide as much context or background.

## May 2020: Internal Alignment
I want to be better at understanding myself through introspection, and to have
fewer mental conflicts. There are some existing ideas I've come across, and I
also want to do more exploration to see what techniques are out there.

It was difficult to figure out where I should get the extra time to do this
month's goals, and I basically decided to delay some maintenance tasks like
writing these blog posts in order to have enough mental space. There is a reason
I never got around to writing up this month's goals!

#### May Goal 1: Consistent Introspection Practice
Practice using meditation, Gendlin focusing, and Internal Double Crux (IDC).
Spend at least an hour (two 30-minute blocks) introspecting at least 3 times a
week, probably mostly on focusing/IDC.

These sometimes felt unproductive, and sometimes unexpected things came up that
caused me to miss a session or two. One of the biggest takeaways was coming up
with a list of desires that I felt I was neglecting in my life without
consciously realizing it, which seems valuable. This was all IDC, I had a
harder time with "focusing" and didn't feel like I had any productive sessions
until the 3rd week, when I tried out some new ideas. (Basically I did the normal
focusing techniques while monitoring a spot in my chest that signaled "warmer"
or "colder" in general). That session felt really cathartic and valuable, but
left me extremely emotionally drained.

Overall I felt like I came up with lots
of ideas and things to process, much faster than I could address them. In
retrospect I think this was good, but I needed a more dedicated followup if I
wanted to really progress. However my goal was introspection and internal
alignment; while I didn't solve internal alignment, I think I improved my
introspective abilities. This was a valuable exercise and it's on the shortlist
for "things I should probably allocate more time to".

#### May Goal 2: Survey of Introspection
Spend several hours this month getting an overview of the ideas around
introspection. Write this out in a document that describes the techniques and
ideas. Estimating 10 hours over the course of the month.

I sought out a couple people who had a reputation of being good at introspection
and had conversations with them. My main takeaway was updating away from thinking
in terms of "here are the techniques, follow these exact steps" and towards a
view that there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution to introspection. I also got
the feedback of being more goal-oriented in my introspection. That was surprising,
as almost nobody ever thinks I'm insufficiently goal-oriented, especially around
subjective topics like this.

I did end up writing a very-rough document of ideas, but I didn't put any effort
in making it legible to other people and I'm not confident it's that helpful.

## June 2020: Tracking and Fixing Issues
Last month I generated a lot of *issues* that I'd prefer were fixed in my life.
I want to create a more consistent habit of introspective checkins to uncover
issues, and specific time for "debugging" those issues.

#### June Goal 1: Regular Introspective Checkins
Do introspective checkins once a week, of one hour.

I didn't feel like I got that much out of these for some reason. One of the
sessions turned into a reflection on the progress I've made over the last 6
months, which was nice.

#### June Goal 2: Allocate Time for Debugging
Spend at least 3 hours a week on this.

Mostly this went towards trying to figure out how I could learn more during my
working hours. That's something I still continue to struggle with, so I don't
think I really solved it that well.

#### June Goal 3: Running
Investigate injury and ramp back up to 5 days a week.

I successfuly spent time researching the injury and doing some self-rehab, which
seemed to help. I wasn't very confident that I'd be consistent with running and
never got around to Murpheyjitsu-ing it, but I am pleasantly surprised that I
was fairly consistent anyways.

## July 2020: Setting Up for Rapid Learning
A recurring theme from last month is that I don't feel fluent in learning new
things. I want to do the "setup" to allow me to dive more into this in coming
months.

#### July Goal 1: Weekend Meandering
I want to add 2 hours of focused time and 2 hours of "productive meandering" on
the weekend. Initially I was skeptical I'd be able to stick to this, but got a
lot more confident after heavy Murpheyjitsu.

I was able to stick to this, but it felt pretty burdensome given how long the
time allocations were. I ended up deciding that practicing StarCraft 2 counts
as productive meandering, and then I spent all my time doing that. But I also
spent a lot of my free time doing it, so this made the weekend meandering
trivially easy. Not sure that that's a problem, but deciding what counts or not
is difficult and important in general.

#### July Goal 2: Work-context Growth
I want to spend at least 5 hours a week focused on building work-relevant
long-term skills during work-time (which my employer approved of).

This proved quite difficult. It was hard to feel like I had the mental energy
for my normal work duties and also this kind of learning, and there is always
background pressure to get things done faster. I did successfully spend some
time learning, but I didn't prioritize it enough to get anywhere near my goal
of 5 hours a week.

#### July Goal 3: Improve Study Ability
Read "How to Read a Book" by the end of the month, and come up with a plan
for practicing that studying skill.

Found it difficult to allocate enough time to this given that I was doing a
different learning project during work hours. I made it through half the book,
and came up with some ideas for practicing.

#### July Goal 4: Focus on the Backlog
In previous months I've accumulated "debt" in terms of racking up important
tasks in my backlog. I want all of my focused time to start by looking at my
task-tracker and picking the most important item. If I want to do something
else, I should first consider whether it is actually more important than the
top backlog item.

I was definitely better about this, but not always consistent. At one point I
had an urgent and important task I had to do, so I basically just always worked
on that. One observation is that I notice that whatever I have pulled up on my
laptop is very influential in what I naturally start to do when I open it in
the morning, so I've started intentionally setting up the opening page the night
before.

#### July Goal 5: Running
Stick to my mileage-building plan. Emphasize injury prevention, foam-roalling,
etc.

This mostly went pretty well, with a session or two that I missed becuase of
scheduling conflicts. Overall I'm happy with it.

## August 2020: Launching Rapid Learning
I've already laid some groundwork, so now I want to dive into figure out how to
learn quickly. None of these goals added to the overall time cost or changed
my "productivity infrastructure" significantly, they are just changes in how I
intend to allocate the energy and systems I've already developed in the last 7
months.

#### August Goal 1: Literature Overview
Find the best books about learning, and do an "inspectional reading" of them
(to use the terminology of "How to Read a Book"). Target of at most 1 hour per
book, getting the main claims, evidence, etc. Write out an outline of these
books. (This also lets me practice the techniques from "How to Read a Book"!)

I "speed-read" 4 books by the end of the month, which is less than I would have
liked. A significant amount of time was spent figuring out online library stuff
so I could get access to a bunch of books for short periods without having to
buy them all outright, and I could have easily fit another book or two in that
time.

My average reading speed was over double my usual average, but still not fast
enough to be considered "skimming". It's difficult and unnatural for me to
skim or speedread, but when I'm really focusing on it I can get another >2x
improvement in speed.

#### August Goal 2: Pay Attention to Skills
I want to get better at StarCraft and Software Engineering (SWE). I'm not
prioritizing these too heavily just yet, but I want to start thinking more
about how I can improve. Especially given the influx of ideas from the above
goal. If ideas seem promising, can try them out during the time I'm already
spending on these skills, and see what happens.

I didn't really do much about this, and I don't particularly feel bad about it.
The goal isn't really concrete or strongly-worded anyways.

#### August Goal 3: Work Time Allocation
Same as before, goal of 5 hours a week of work-context learning. Can overlap
with the literature review above by skimming books about learning
Software-related skills.

Continued to struggle here, and continue to feel pressure to focus solely on
short-term project completion.

#### August Goal 4: Running
I was thrown off a bit by having lots of weekend plans that prevented running,
but at least I generally had some form of exercise which was long enough. This
will happen this month as well, and I won't consider that bad. Goal
is to build up mileage to 5 hours / week and be consistent on days where I don't
have extensive plans.

I ended up deprioritizing this because I had a big backpacking trip planned, and
I wasn't feeling confident that my running injuries would be well-behaved. I
tried biking instead, but wasn't consistent about it. After the trip I was good
about being consistent with running.

## September 2020: More Meta-Learning Setup
I want to continue the meta-learning project that I kicked off last month.

#### September Goal 1: More Literature Review!
Keep practicing with speedreading/skimming, aiming for more consistent speed.
Based on the research I've already done, I also want to do spaced-repetition
active-recall challenges where I try to summarize all the important bits of
the books I've skimmed from memory. I'm using Anki to do the spaced repetition
selection, then try to recall as much of my notes as possible, then cross-check
with my actual written notes.

#### September Goal 2: Work-Context Learning
Continuing on last month, as I keep struggling with this.

#### September Goal 3: Running
No longer bothered by injuries from last month, build mileage back up, target
is still 5 hours a week. Also try to do more stretching and foam-rolling (this
is ad-hoc and not very operationalized, just noting it down as an intention).

Lots of random stuff got in the way here, including an injury in the 4th week.
Tried to ramp back up afterwards but had more problems, so I backed off again.
My running goals always have the caveat "doesn't apply if injured" and this
doesn't mean I did anything wrong.
