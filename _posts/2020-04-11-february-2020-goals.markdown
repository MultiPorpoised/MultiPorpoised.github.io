My goals for [january]({% post_url 2020-02-15-january-2020-retrospective
%}){:target="_blank"}
went well, so I'm hoping to continue the momentum
this month.

Last month I focused on building up some personal productivity time in order to
kick-start my ability to drive personal growth.
Now that I have some "income" to spend, the most pressing thing
right now feels like paying down my "high-interest debt". That is, the set of
backlogged tasks which most heavily weigh on my mind and are most detrimental to
leave undone. I believe that there is more than enough work in this category
to fill a month at my current rate of time investment,
and that doing so will be more beneficial than trying to jump directly into
other projects.

Like January, February feels like a particularly critical time to build this
habit. I'm no longer riding the New-Year's wave, so this is the first month I'll
be depending almost entirely on the mechanisms I put in place last month. I'm
writing this post retroactively, but I *did* write these goals up in a document
on January 31st and sent them out to my [challenge network](https://twitter.com/adammgrant/status/940719732843515905?lang=en){:target="_blank"},
who were able to provide helpful feedback and encouragement. This post (and all
monthly goal posts) is based on the associated document and is written from the
perspective of the time that the document was shared, not from the perspective
of when the associated blog post goes live.

So with the motivation out of the way, let's jump into the specifics:

## Goal 1: Systematize the Backlog
Right now I track tasks, ideas, projects, and TO-DO items is several different
places. These include phone notes, todoist, workflowy, phone reminders, calendar
reminders, miscellaneous pieces of paper, and sometimes just my brain.
I don't have any habits around checking
these locations, and some of them I haven't visited in years. This does not seem
like an ideal way to track tasks I care about. Instead I would like some single
unified system, and a set of habits for interacting with it.

I would like this unified system to support several key use-cases. It should be
trivially easy to add new tasks to some kind of "inbox" whenever they come to
mind, which also means easy mobile access is a must.
It should also support time-based reminders and recurring items.

I should be able to put
items into buckets by an approximate estimation of value-per-unit-time, which
should be the primary prioritization metric. That is, the system should enable
me to visually sort tasks by how much value I expect to get out of spending time
on that task. I also hope that repeatedly attempting to measure new ideas on
this metric will help me improve my ability to estimate it.

Finally, it should
support a similar type of visual sorting by "urgency", or an estimate of how
quickly the value of a task decays over time if left undone. Some tasks, like
exploring new forms of exercise, might have a low urgency, even if they would be
very valuable. If I don't get around to it now, it will have almost identical
value in the future. By comparison, hard near-term deadlines impose a high
degree of urgency. Keeping "value" and "urgency" distinct in my head is
something I've always found difficult, but hopefully making this kind of clean
separation will help. I don't want to perpetually fall into the trap of
prioritizing urgent but low-value tasks over non-urgent but high-value ones.

This month I want to create such a system to my satisfaction, or at least
allocate 5 hours to figuring it out (predict 70% chance of success). The only
reason my prediction is this low is because it is at most my 3rd highest
priority task this month, the other 2 being large high-value high-urgency items
that I deferred in January. I won't consider it a failure if the only reason I
don't get to this is because I'm too busy working on more important things.
Despite this, I expect (95%) that I will allocate at least 1 hour. I also expect
this to be a first stab at a system that will evolve as I use it, and
expect to make at least one nontrivial change after using the system for a
couple weeks (70%).

## Goal 2: Pay Down the Worst "Debt"
As mentioned above, I have some particularly high-value high-urgency items on my
plate right now, especially as I had deferred things in January to make room for
creating my monthly goal system. This
month I want to focus on clearing the worst of these off so they don't get in
the way of future monthly goals. Note that evaluating something and deciding to
deprioritize it is an absolutely valid way of dealing with backlogged tasks.

I predict that with concerted effort, I could complete all high-value and
high-urgency tasks up to and including writing this blog post and the January
retrospective, before the end of the month (70%). Here "concerted effort" just
means spending all the time I had carved out of my schedule through the January
goals. I predict that I will spend at least 80% of this productive time in
February primarily working on these backlog items (95%).

## Goal 3: Carry Forward January Goals
This one is pretty self-explanatory, except that I plan to relax some of my
requirements. For instance, instead of requiring myself to do my weekend work
block at a library, I can do it at home if I feel confident in my ability to do
so. Now that the habit is much more firmly ingrained, I'm not as worried about
my adherence. I'll also be less strict about the exact composition and daily
timing of my strength and cross-training workouts.

I predict that throughout February, I will continue to adhere to my productive
work-block habits on weekdays and weekends (90%). I will carry through January
goal 3 by writing and publishing a January retrospective, writing and sending
out a draft document for February goals, and doing the same for March (60%). The
prediction is not that high because I expect to prioritize the "debt" described
in Goal 2, and wouldn't be surprised if that ate up too much time to get to all
these. I predict that I will continue cross-training and building up mileage as
part of my 4th January goal, under the new more-lax rules (85%).

## Parting Thoughts
I've updated towards being slightly more confident in my predictions due to the
success of January. I didn't update super heavily, because January could be an
outlier and has the advantage of being the first month of the year, which
benefits from New Year's energy.

In the future, I don't expect to explicitly call out that I will be carrying
forward new habits from previous months. Anything that is a recurring time-usage
or system habit will be recurring by default (including timing and existence of
work blocks and usage of my new backlog system). Goals related to concrete tasks
(such as Goal 2 about clearing off my backlog) will not recur by default. I
expect these to be intuitively obvious to me, and hopefully to anyone else
reading these posts.
