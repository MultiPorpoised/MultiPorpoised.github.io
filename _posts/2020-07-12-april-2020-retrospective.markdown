After the
[disaster]({% post_url 2020-06-22-march-2020-retrospective %}){:target="_blank"}
that was March, I was fortunately able to do better with respect to
[this month's goals]({% post_url 2020-07-10-april-2020-goals %}){:target="_blank"}.
The overarching theme of April was getting my systems and habits back on track
and making them more resilient, and as far as I can tell it has worked out.

## Outcome of [Goal 1]({% post_url 2020-07-10-april-2020-goals %}#goal-1-delineated-daily-schedule){:target="_blank"} (Delineated Daily Schedule)
Overall I was surprised by what a significant quality-of-life improvement this
goal led to. My work time felt more focused and productive, which meant I felt
better about it and less stressed/guilty, which in turn made it even easier to
focus. It certainly seemed like my subconscious got the picture about what the
transitions were and what I was supposed to be doing in each of the segments.
If anything this is probably just a testament to the badness of
self-reinforcing cycles of stress and avoidance.

While the impact on weekdays was very positive, I had a more negative experience
on weekends. I found myself often getting annoyed by how little time and
flexibility it felt like I had, especially when I had other events and chores to
do. I just had a hard time getting started on Saturday morning after a full work
week, looking over my schedule for the day, and realizing I wouldn't be able to
"relax" for the equivalent of another full work day. In addition, forcing the
"down" transition to be exercise and a shower really limited my options. I
usually like to run in the evenings, but my plan meant that I have to run
whenever I finish working for the day, which on weekends would be afternoon or
first thing in the morning.

Despite these obstacles I did successfully achieve my adherence goals for the
first 2 weeks, earning a satisfying reward. There was one point where a personal
emergency prevented me from doing the usual downward transition, but there was
never any doubt in my mind that it was the right decision. This is
exactly the kind of scenario I had in mind when I added an escape clause for "if
itâ€™s obvious that I would have made an exception for a situation if I thought of
it in advance, then I can treat it as an exception".

I definitely would have
convinced myself to loosen up the requirements if I didn't have something on the
line being tracked. After the halfway reward mark I decided to loosen the
requirements on weekends,
so that I can interleave relaxation and productive time without worrying about
having a single transition (though I still stuck to the up transition). Forcing
myself to stick to the full specified goal for the first half of the month made
me get used to the new system enough to know which parts I could get used to,
and which continued to feel counterproductive in practice - this is a setup I'll
likely repeat in the future.

In general I believe this should be considered a success on all counts, though
I technically didn't stick to the letter of the weekend-downward-transition
requirement in the latter half of the month. I should probably add another
escape clause of the form: "If after 2 weeks of trying some system I am
confident it is not successfully promoting the goals it was designed to promote,
then I can make adjustments for the second half of the month". Subject to the
usual conservative interpretation to avoid tempting myself into needlessly
giving in to short-term discomfort, of course.


## Outcome of [Goal 2]({% post_url 2020-07-10-april-2020-goals %}#goal-2-re-establish-habits){:target="_blank"} (Re-Establish Habits)
This goal was surprisingly easier than the one above, despite nominally taking
more time and effort. To me this is some notable evidence that habits don't
actually decay that quickly even if you stop doing them for a few weeks.
I initially specified that this had
its own separate reward system from the one above, but I all but forgot about
that until afterwards. In my head all four subgoals were required in order to
reach my 2-week target, and once I got past the first few days I had no problem
continuing. In this regard my 70% prediction for doing proper productive
meandering was probably overly pessimistic.

Though I technically achieved what I set out to achieve with this goal, my
running frequency has taken a hit and isn't where I'd like it to be. I've leaned
far too heavily on the option I left for myself of just doing 15 minutes of
random exercises and calling it a day. The most common failure mode is that I
often want to join in social dinners, but I don't have enough time to run
beforehand and afterwards I feel too full to run until it is too late.
I'm not exactly sure what to do here, but I'll just call it out and consider
making an explicit running consistency goal in May.


## Outcome of [Goal 3]({% post_url 2020-07-10-april-2020-goals %}#goal-3-catch-up-on-the-backlog){:target="_blank"} (Catch Up on the Backlog)
This goal didn't pan out at all. I caught up on the biggest most important item,
but everything else remains on the backlog. I need to be less confident
going forward about my ability to clear backlog items quickly, because I always
seem to assume that no new tasks will pop up, which they always do.

Unlike the above 2 goals, this one didn't have an implementation plan where I
thought about what might go wrong and how to build habits and systems to avoid
those failures. In the future I'll avoid such barren goals and put in some more
thought, even if the takeaway is just explicitly calling out "I don't think this
will cause any trouble".

## Other Takeaways
One weekend I finally got the chance to play video games for several consecutive
hours for the first time in a while,
which felt nice. The following day I felt unusually motivated to do things like
write, which was a very positive development. Lots (most?) of my problems would
be solved if I just intrinsically felt like doing the kinds of things I talk
about here, so anything that promotes that is a plus. This probably indicates
that my motivation systems usually don't feel like I have enough play/relaxation
time, which is something I should keep in mind. That being said, it's unclear
how much of that is just adapting to a new scheduling set-point, and how much is
an unchanging constant. I've certainly had feelings in the past of "I am trying
to spend too much time working", but once I've actually gotten used to it and
scheduled tasks that aren't super aversive, it got much easier.
