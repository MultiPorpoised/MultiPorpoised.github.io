I would consider
[February]({% post_url 2020-04-11-february-2020-goals %}){:target="_blank"}
a success in all important ways.

## Outcome of [Goal 1]({% post_url 2020-04-11-february-2020-goals %}#goal-1-systematize-the-backlog){:target="_blank"} (Backlog System)

I am very happy with where this ended up. In February I spent somewhere in the
range of 5 hours thinking through my desired task management properties, doing
research, trying out different tools, settling upon a workflow, and migrating
everything to it. In the end I was able to land on one that seems to have served
me well for the rest of the month - an outcome I estimated at (70%) at the
time the goal was formulated.

My system is built upon [Trello](https://trello.com/){:target="_blank"}.
Trello allows you to create lists with items in them, move items between lists,
tag items with colorful markers, add notes, set deadlines, search for tasks, and
archive, among a variety of other less
important features (to me). An image is worth a thousand words, so an example of
my system is shown below
(click [here](/assets/trello_example.png){:target="_blank"} for full-size).

I have an "inbox" list for items that I think about and want to quickly track,
without having to try and prioritize them. Trello has good mobile support, so I
can quickly add items from my phone without navigating a bunch of menus. Tasks
themselves are organized into lists by an estimate of value-per-unit-time I
expect from working on that task (V0 is the highest, V2 is the lowest, anything
lower than V2 doesn't deserve to be tracked). They are tagged with a color
indicating the "urgency" (from U0-U3), which is an estimate of how quickly the
potential value of the task will go down as I leave the task undone. More
details in the
[original goal]({% post_url 2020-04-11-february-2020-goals %}#goal-1-systematize-the-backlog){:target="_blank"}.

Trello allows setting mobile push reminders when due-dates hit (or beforehand if
you prefer), which I use as a configurable notification system. If I want to be
reminded of a certain task on a certain day, I can add a due-date.
It also allows for tracking due-dates in the more standard way (of when the item
is actually due), but I usually navigate that by
setting a due-date for the time when I think I should next work on the item,
rather than setting a due date for when it should be complete. This system is
all about helping me pick what tasks to work on when, so I find that more
useful.

If there are no further actions I need to take on a specific task right now,
but I want it to come back on my radar in the future, I put it in the "awaiting" list.
This is a list for items that have no next action, but have a due-date (this
task is "awaiting" some trigger before it becomes re-activated). When the
date hits I am reminded to deal with it appropriately. I use this for recurring
time-based tasks such as weekly laundry reminders, as well as reminders about
upcoming appointments or meetings. I also often use this for periodic check-ins,
for tasks whose next step is of the form "see if there are any new developments,
and if not extend the due-date". This makes it easy to send out pings or
reminders if other parties are involved.

And of course there is a column for recently-completed tasks, which I
periodically archive. I could archive the tasks directly after completing them,
but this lets me track which archived tasks were completed versus those who were
archived for other reasons, such as deprioritization. And it just feels nice to
add completed tasks to a growing list.

After landing upon this system, I migrated all my old backlog items from my
various storage places into it. I tried to lower every item's value-
and urgency-ratings as much I could tolerate, as I tend to naturally look at
everything and think "oh, this could be important". The tasks ended up with a
fairly even spread among value and urgency, and many tasks were
deprioritized altogether in this process, which I consider a success.
I still have a lot of work to do in improving my intuitive ratings for value and
urgency. Right now my "value" ratings tend to naturally include a lot of weight
on how urgent something feels, and I have to put in a lot of effort to
explicitly try and separate those. It feels like I'm a bit better than I was, so
that's at least somewhat encouraging.

Since creating this system I've found it very helpful. For one thing, the
reminder system has felt very powerful and has many times successfully reminded
me to revist a task that had completely fallen off my radar. For another,
whenever I finish something and am looking for the next task, this will help
me prioritize, and I often find myself deciding upon tasks that didn't even
come to mind in the few seconds I normally
allow myself to make those decisions. When I look at the board of tasks,
my attention is generally spent almost completely on a triangle in the upper
right corner, focusing naturally on tasks that are both valuable and urgent.
Note that oftentimes, when I start a work
block there will be some obvious task that I should
work on, usually because I'm already in the middle of it. In these cases I don't
check the system at all, and just get right to the obvious next thing.

I initially predicted (70%) likelihood that I would make some significant change
after using the system for a while, and it turns out that I did.
My first iteration of the system involved a
trello tool that allowed for duplicating tasks on a timer, for instance allowing
me to create a _new_ laundry task every week. This very quickly led to lots of
clutter, and I had some problems with being unable to stop cards from endlessly
duplicating. After thinking about it for a bit, I realized I didn't actually
need different cards, I could just reset a due-date reminder on the existing
card, which gave way to the "awaiting" list. This system feels much nicer, and
the "awaiting" list turned out to be useful for a variety of other use-cases.

## Outcome of [Goal 2]({% post_url 2020-04-11-february-2020-goals %}#goal-2-pay-down-the-worst-debt){:target="_blank"} (Pay Down Debt)

I predicted a 70% chance that I would clear
out the top items on my priority list, which in order were the two large tasks
mentioned earlier, deciding upon and drafting March goals, setting up the task
management system from [goal 1]({% post_url 2020-04-11-february-2020-goals %}#goal-1-systematize-the-backlog){:target="_blank"},
writing the [January retrospective]({% post_url 2020-02-15-january-2020-retrospective %}){:target="_blank"}
post, and writing this February retrospective post. I successfully
cleared all but the last one by the end of the month (as you can probably tell
by the date attached with this post). I did spend at least 80% of my time
working on these tasks, as predicted.

In [goal 3]({% post_url 2020-04-11-february-2020-goals %}#goal-3-carry-forward-january-goals){:target="_blank"}
I predicted a 60% chance that I would finish the January
retrospective and march goals draft, which is a lower probability of only
completing a subset of these items. I think that was a more reasonable
estimation, and I underestimated the number of things I was committing to by
saying "all high-value and high-urgency tasks up to and including writing
this blog post and the January retrospective". I did not meet the 70%
prediction, so I should update downwards a little bit. (Note that this is a
failure of prediction, I don't think there was anything wrong with how I spent
this month).

## Outcome of [Goal 3]({% post_url 2020-04-11-february-2020-goals %}#goal-3-carry-forward-january-goals){:target="_blank"} (Carry Goals Forward)

This also went well overall. I continue to make use of my accountability
structures and send out documents outlining my monthly goals in a timely
fashion. I continue to do my work blocks on weekday mornings on the bus. I
continue to go to the library every weekend to get that work block done - with
the exception of one weekend, in which I had a full 2-day commitment. In that
case I got
my work done in a bunch of small ~30-minute increments where possible, but
didn't go to the library. I consider that a good way to navigate situations like
that.

My cross-training wasn't as regimented but I still mostly stuck with it. After
doing it for 2 months I think I'm coming up on some diminishing returns, and
will probably not continue committing to this goal. I may bring it back sometime
in the future if I decide I want to do another cycle.

As I mentioned in my
[last parting thoughts]({% post_url 2020-04-11-february-2020-goals %}#parting-thoughts){:target="_blank"},
I don't plan on continuing to explicitly call
out this carry-forward goal every month. That being said, I would still like to
write up any retrospective notes if anything didn't go as planned.

## Other Takeaways
I am once again surprised and encouraged by how well this monthly-goal system
seems to be working. In terms of improving my future ability to get personal
work done, I feel like the progress in this month has improved my capabilities,
though not nearly to the extent of January. I feel like the hardest part of
ingraining this new monthly-goal system is now over, but I have to continue
being somewhat vigilant in the next couple months to make sure it stays that
way.

I once again did better than my probability estimates indicated, so I should
once again update my confidence upwards a bit.
